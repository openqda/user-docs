## Change your password
You can change your password by entering your current password and the new password twice to confirm it.
If you forgot your current password, you can use the password reset feature on the login page.
We recommend using a password manager to generate and store secure passwords.

## Delete your account

> :alert: Danger zone! Deleting your account is permanent and will remove all your data from our servers.
> This action cannot be undone. We cannot recover your account or any associated data once it has been deleted.

You can delete your account by clicking the "Delete account" button at the bottom of the page.
The delete button is disabled as long as there are teams you are the owner of with active members.
In that case you will first have to [transfer ownership or delete the teams](projects/teams.md).
