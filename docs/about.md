# What is OpenQDA?

OpenQDA is a sustainable, free/libre Open Source Software for collaborative qualitative data analysis.

It is developed by the [ZeMKI (Centre for Media, Communication and Information Research)](https://zemki.uni-bremen.de/)
at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/) and publicly available under https://openqda.org.
There, it is hosted at the university's infrastructure.

## Software Freedom

OpenQDA intends to be as free as possible. This means for you, that

- you are free to use our hosted version
- you are free to get the software and host it on your own infrastructure
- you are free to change, distribute and anything else, allowed by the software license
- you are free to publish you data, processed within OpenQDA (other rules and laws about scientific practice and
  publishing data remain untouched)

## QDA Workflow

Currently, OpenQDA follows a generic fundamental QDA workflow, which may be subject to future changes and
improvements.

- **Preparation** - project and data management.
- **Coding** - the actual process of assigning codes and refining your data
- **Analysis** - analyzing and visualizing your coded sources

## Collaboration

OpenQDA is still under constant development and provides a limited set of collaboration features:

- you can collaborate in teams
- you can view who is working on which page
- you can collaboratively code the same source

Future versions will include more complete collaboration features.
You can keep track of them in our [roadmap](https://github.com/openqda/openqda/milestones).
