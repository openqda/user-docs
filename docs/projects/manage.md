# Manage your project
Your project is organized in different views:
- [Overviev](#overview)
- [Collaboration](./teams.md)
- [Codebooks](./codebooks.md)
- [History](./history.md)

Each comes with own features, functionality and complexity,
which we want to present you in the following sections.

## Overview
The default view when selecting a project is the overview tab.
In this view you can edit your project information or delete the entire project, including all it's data.

## Delete a project

> [!CAUTION]
> ⚠️ Deleting a project is **final and permanent**. There is no way to recover a deleted project,
> not by yourself (self-hosted), nor by the admins (managed).

If you intend to delete your project then click on "Delete". A prompt appears, asking you to type the project's name
exactly as given (case- and whitespace sensitive).

The delete button will only become clickable, when the project name is entered as required:

![delete project prompt](../public/img/create_project/delete_active.png)

Now you can click on "Delete". The project and all its data is deleted, and you will
be redirected to projects overview, where no project is selected.
