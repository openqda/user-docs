# Analysis

When you are done coding one or more of your documents, you might want to get some help interpreting what you coded or have a deeper look into your coded sections. To do your analysis, go to the **Analysis** tab section on the top right of the screen. At the moment, OpenQDA offers three different analysis options. You can choose them from the drop-down menu on the top right, and they are:
- **List** Here you can list all your coded text snippets. Select all the documents and all the codes you want to include in your analysis, either by selectively checking each one individually or by clicking the "All files"/"All Codes" options. Your output on the left side of the screen will then contain all text sections that fulfill your selection criteria, structured by document. You can also export your result as a *.CSV file for further processing by clicking the **CSV** button in the top right corner.
- **Code Portrait** The code protrait gives you an overview of the code distribution in a document. As before, you can select codes and documents on the right hand side. Your output on the left will then show you the distribution of the selected codes over the selectes documents. Each instance is represented by a little square in the color of the code.
- **Word Cloud** The word cloud is a visualisation of the word distribution in your selection. As before, you select documents and codes, and the word cloud shows you which words occur most or least frequently in your selection, by displaying them larger or smaller. You also have some adjustment options concerning the presentation as well as the words included.

And that's it, you now know the basics of OpenQDA. If you have any questions, encounter any bugs, have ideas for improvements or features, you can always visit us on Github at [github.com/openqda](https://github.com/openqda "github.com/openqda") and write [feedback](https://github.com/openqda/feedback) there or write us an email at [openqda@uni-bremen.de](mailto:openqda@uni-bremen.de)

## What next?

We are constantly working on improvements to OpenQDA or implementing new features and functions, to get an overview over what is planned next, you can check out our [milestones](https://github.com/openqda/openqda/milestones), where you are of course also invited to contribute.
