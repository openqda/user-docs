## Destructive actions
Several actions that cause a deletion (of Codes, Selections, Projects, Codebooks, Source etc.) are **finite and permanent**.
There is no way to restore them after deleting, even not for administrators.

Be aware of this during your work when attempting to delete something.

## Availability
There is no guarantee for a 24/7 availability of OpenQDA, due to several circumstances:
- installation of updates or new releases
- database migrations for backup (usually at night)
- outages and events beyond our control

## Stability and Validity
We are working constantly on improving OpenQDA.
However, we can not provide you a legally binding guarantee for OpenQDA to work 100% valid and reliable.
Take this into consideration and do all your QDA steps with care.

If you think you found parts of OpenQDA that do not work as expected or are subject
of threat to your research, please do not hesitate to [contact us](./contact.md)!
