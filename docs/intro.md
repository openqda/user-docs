# Introduction to OpenQDA

Let's discover **OpenQDA in under 10 minutes**.

## Register a new account

Head over to [the OpenQDA website at openqda.org](https://openqda.org).

Click on the orange **Register** button.
![Register to OpenQDA](../static/img/register_96dpi.png "Register Button")

Now fill out the register form with your name or pseudonym, your email and a secure password.
Then confirm that you are not a robot (to your knowledge) and click the **Register** button.

> :bulb: **Tip:** While currently it is only required that your password consists of a minimum of eight characters, we recommend using a mix of letters, numbers and special characters.

![Register to OpenQDA](../static/img/register_filled_96dpi.png "Register your account")

> :postbox: A verification email should have been sent to the email address you provided - please open it and click the link to verify your email address and complete the registration process.

Now that you are verified, you can log into OpenQDA with your mail address and password and start using the software by either editing your profile or creating a new project for data analysis.

## Create your first project

Your work in OpenQDA is organized in projects.

Fill out the project form and give your first project a nice name (and optionally write a description, for example your research question).
Then click the **Create a new project** button.
Your new project is created, and you go to the project tab. If you want to go back and create more projects or switch between projects, click on Qudi, the little blue owl, in the left corner (this will change in the next version of OpenQDA, because it is not self-evident).

## Manage your project 

OpenQDA is organized in four different tabs oriented on the workflow of a typical QDA project. Those tabs are "Project", "Preparation", "Coding" and "Analysis", and you find them at the top of your screen. When you create a new project, you will find yourself at first in the "Project" tab of OpenQDA. Here, in the **Overview** you can update the project name or project description of your project and even delete your project.

In the sub tab **Collaboration** you can set up your project to work with others. We skip this part for now.

In the sub tab **Codebook** you can manage different codebooks, share, reuse and import codebooks from other people. To create an empty codebook for your project, simply enter a name and optionally a description and click the blue "Create" button.

> :exclamation: **Please note:** OpenQDA gives you the option to share your codebooks with other users of the platform. To do so, click the little checkbox next to "Shared with public" when creating your codebook. It will then appear in the **Public Codebooks** section and others can import a copy of it into their projects. This will not have any effect on the codebook in *your* project.

In the sub tab **History** you see a full log of all actions within the project.

> :bulb: **Tip:** BTW, if you want to edit your profile picture, click on the profile picture in the upper right corner of the screen (at the moment it should just be your initials) and select "Profile". Now you can select a new photo for your profile by uploading it from your hard drive. You can also change your name or password..



## Upload and prepare a text file

Great work on creating your first project! But that project is still empty. To change that, let's upload our first text file and prepare it for coding. To do so, switch to the "Preparation" tab. That's the second tab from the left on top of your screen.

> :exclamation: **Please note** At the moment, OpenQDA only supports *.RTF and *.TXT files. Other common file formats, like *.DOC, *.DOCX or *.PDF files might be supported at a later date. OpenQDA has a plug-in architecture: We, you, or other people in the community are able create import plug-ins for other file formats.

Now, to upload an existing file, click the **Import** button to select a *.TXT or *.RTF file. Click on the title of the document to see the contents of the file in the editor in the right pane. Now you can edit the document and prepare it for coding, if necessary.

![Importing a document file into OpenQDA](../static/img/document_selection_96dpi.png "Importing a document file")

The editor works just like any word processor you know. Here you can add or delete text and also format the text according to your needs. Don't forget to click the **Save** button above the text to make your changes permanent. This way you can even create documents directly in OpenQDA. Just click the **New File** butten next to the **Import** button on the top left. You can then type or paste your text contents (for example from a *.PDF file) into the newly created document. Again, don't forget to save your work.
If you click on the three little dots next to a file name, you can also rename the document or delete it from your project.

When you are done editing your file, you can press the **Lock and Code** button to lock the file and start coding.

> :exclamation: **Please note** Please be aware that once you started coding a document, you can not unlock it anymore to make further edits. Once coding started, editing ends.

## Coding the text

By clicking the **Lock and Code** button at the document preparation or simply by clicking the **Coding** tab (the third one from the left) on the top of your screen you get to the **Coding** section.

On the left hand side you see your document (you can switch between locked documents with the blue menu button).
On the right hand side is your codebook (or code system/code tree/code collection/...). To start coding, you need to activate at least one codebook. You can do that by clicking the little cog wheel and then select one of the available codebooks. 

Since we only created one codebook when we created the project, we just choose that one.

![Activating a codebook](../static/img/selecting_codebook_96dpi.png "Activating a codebook")

If you do not have any codes in your code book, you can create them by clicking on **+ Add Code**. A new code with a radomly created name and color appears. You can edit its name by double clicking on the text and you can change the color via the menu that opens by clicking the three vertical dots on the right side of each code. The color change is the first entry.

![Changing the color of a code](../static/img/changing_code_color_96dpi.png "Changing the color")

You can also find the options to create subcodes or move your codes around in that same menu.

If you would like to create a note (or memo) for a code, simply click the little notepad icon next to the name of the code. This opens a little yellow "Post It" note for your text.

There are three different ways to code text in OpenQDA:
- making a text selection by highlighting it with the pressed left mouse button and use **right mouse click** to open a contextual menu and then click on the desired a code for the highlighted text
- making a text selection by highlighting it with the pressed left mouse button and then clicking and holding the selection with the left mouse button and **dragging it** to onto the desired code on the right
- making a text selection by highlighting it with the pressed left mouse button and then **dragging the desired code** from the coding system onto the selected text

> :bulb: **Tip:** You don't actually have to "aim" for your text selection, it's enough to drag the code anywhere in your document.

> :exclamation: **Please note** Please be aware that all options involving dragging only work on Macs and PCs, not on smartphones or tablets (we are working on it).

## Analysis

To do your analysis, go to the **Analysis** tab section.

## What next?
