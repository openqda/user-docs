# Introduction to OpenQDA

Let's discover **OpenQDA in under 10 minutes**.

## Register a new account

Head over to [the OpenQDA website at openqda.org](https://openqda.org).

![Register to OpenQDA](/static/img/register_96dpi.PNG "Register Button")
Click on the orange **Register** button.

Now fill out the register form with your name or pseudonym, your email and a secure password.
Then confirm that you are not a robot (to your knowledge) and click the **Register** button.

IMG
A verification email should have been sent to the email address you provided - please open it and click the link for verification.

IMG
Now that you are verified, you can either edit your profile or create a project.

## Create your first project

Your work in OpenQDA is organized in projects.

IMG
Fill out the project form and give Your first project a nice name (and optionally write a description).
Then click the **Create a new project** button.
Your new project is created, and you go to the project tab. If you want to go back and create more projects or switch between projects, click on the little blue owl in the left corner (this will change in the next version of OpenQDA, because it is not self-evident).

## Manage your project 

You are now in the project tab of OpenQDA. Here you can change the project name, project description and even delete your project.
In the sub tab **Collaboration** you can set up your project to work with others. We skip this part for now.
In the sub tab **Codebook** you can manage different codebooks, share, reuse and import codebooks from other people. We skip this part also.
In the sub tab **History** you see a full log of all actions within the project.

BTW, if you want to edit your profile picture, click on the profile picture in the right upper corner, right now it should be your initials, and select profile. Now you can select a new photo for your profile, change your name or password.

## Upload and prepare a text file

Let's upload and prepare our first text file for coding (right now, OpenQDA only supports RTF and TXT files - NO .doc, .docx or .pdf files!).
Please click on the **Preparation** tab at the top of the page.

IMG
Now you can import TXT or RTF files into OpenQDA (as OpenQDA has a plug-in architecture, we or other people of the community may create import plug-ins for other file formats).
Click the **Import** button to select a TXT or RTF file. Click on the title of the document to see the contents of the file in the editor in the right pane. Now you can edit the document.

You can also create new text documents when you click **New file**. You can then paste your text contents into the new document.

When you are ready with editing, you can press the **Lock and Code** button to lock the file and start coding.

## Coding the text

Now you are in the **Coding** tab section.
In the left pane there is your text (you can switch between texts with the blue menu button).
On the right you see your codes pane. Right now you need to activate a codebook to start coding.
If you do not have any codes in your code book, let's create one by clicking on **Add Code**.
A new code category appears. You can edit it's name by double clicking on the text. 
You can also create a note (click on the pen icon).
To create subcodes or move your codes, click on the mini-menu button of the code.
You can code text in 3 ways:
- make a text selection and use right mouse click / contextual menu click and select a code
- drag the text selection to the code
- drag the code to the text selection
All dragging only works on Macs and PCs, not on smartphones or tablets (we are working on it).

## Analysis

To do your analysis, go to the **Analysis** tab section.

## What next?
