You might have noticed the "Checking if you are a human" section and wonder whether this
is using a third-party tool with privacy implications.
We are not sending data to third parties and the tool (https://altcha.org) is a self-hosted,
privacy aware alternative to commercial tools.


## Verify your account

A verification email should have been sent to the email address you provided - please open it and click the link to 
verify your email address and complete the registration process.
Please also check the spam/junk folders to make sure you received the email in time.

Now that you are verified, you can log into OpenQDA with your mail address and password and start using the software by
either editing your profile or creating a new project for data analysis.
