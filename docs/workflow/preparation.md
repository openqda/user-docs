# Preparation

This part of the workflow deals with all the preparations of your Sources.
A source in [REFI](../refi.md) can be any material that is subject to your coding and analysis,
ranging from text files to media, such as audio and video or custom complex formats.

> [!NOTE]
> For now OpenQDA supports only text-based Sources, as well as Audio, which is transcribed to text.
> Future releases may increase the set of supported source formats.

## Create a new Source
You can create a new empty (text-) source by clicking on the "+ Create" button on the left panel.
Then provide a name of the file and click "Create" to finish creation.

From there you can add your custom text (formatted or unformatted) using the editor on the right panel.
