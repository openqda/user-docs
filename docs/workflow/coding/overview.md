# Coding

You have finally arrived at the stage where you will do the actual coding.
Note, that OpenQDA refers to codes as reusable categories that you can assign to segments
of your sources. Such an assignment is named a "Selection".

If you come from other QDA software you might want to look at our [REFI-based temrinology](../../refi.md).

## Coding page
The coding takes place on the coding page, which you can reach by [selecting a project](../../projects/manage.md)
and then click on the coding icon on the left navigation bar.

### Left panel: code management
The main purpose of the left panel is to manage codes.
Read the page on [managing codes](./codes.md) for further information.

#### Cleanup
The "cleanup" tab, lists any selections, codes or codebooks, that might contain references that
lead to non-existing targets. You will not need this functionality unless you are actively informed about it
by OpenQDA.

### Right panel: selection management
The right panel focuses entirely on managing selection.
Assignments of codes to parts of sources is commonly referred to as coding. In OpenQDA, however these assignments
are not named "codes" but "selections".

Although the editor might look like the same as [the editor from the preparations view](../preparation/editing.md),
it inhibits an entirely different functionality.
There is an [entire page on how selections work](./selections.md) and how you can interact with it.
