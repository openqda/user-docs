# Editing Sources
Once a source is ready and is not locked you are free to format it to your team's preferred
formatting rules.

> [!NOTE]
> For now there is no way to auto-enforce automated formatting rules.
> In the future, there might be plugins to implement similar features.

## Editor lines
We actively decided against fixed line lengths or other line-based formatting, since
they are not universally experienced across devices and screen sizes.

Paragraphs without line breaks are considered a single line in OpenQDA.
Hence, you will see some text blocks being associated with a single line number, while
others are associated "line by line":
